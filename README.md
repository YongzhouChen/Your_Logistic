# Your_Logistic
This is a Logistic model created all by yourself.
Make sure that the X is a matrix and y only contains two types of values.
In addition, you can set the Max iteration by "Max_iter" and Learning rate by "learning_rate".
However, the condition of convergence is not provided in this version.

Moreover, a LOO(Leave-One-Out) method has also been provided.
You can use it by "cyz_LOO(X,y,model)".However, we've only achieved the model of cyz_Logistic in this version.

For help, you can library("cyz") and then use "?cyz_Logistic" or "?cyz_LOO" for specific help.
